# Face Detection and Information Entry

This Python application utilizes OpenCV for face detection, Tkinter for the GUI, and SQLite for data storage. It allows users to capture faces using a webcam, enter information such as name, surname, and phone number associated with the captured face, and save this information along with the image of the captured face. Additionally, it sends a WhatsApp message to the provided phone number notifying the user about the captured face.

## Features

- Face Detection and Capture: Utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using a webcam and capture them.
- Information Entry: Users can enter additional information such as name, surname, and phone number for the captured face.
- Data Storage: Stores captured faces and associated information in an SQLite database for easy retrieval and management.
- WhatsApp Notification: Sends a WhatsApp message to the provided phone number with the captured photo, notifying the user about the newly captured face.
- User-Friendly GUI: The application features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface built using Tkinter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Tkinter
- Pillow (`PIL`)
- SQLite3
- Twilio Python library (`twilio`)
- Twilio Account SID, Authentication Token, and a Twilio phone number (for sending WhatsApp messages)

## Setup

1. Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python tkinter pillow twilio

2. Twilio Account Setup: Create a Twilio account if you don't have one already: [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). Obtain your Twilio Account SID, Authentication Token, and a Twilio phone number.

3. Clone Repository: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

4. Update Twilio Credentials: Update the `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` constants in the script with your Twilio credentials.

## Usage

1. Run Script: Execute the script:
python face_capture.py

2. Capture Face: Click on the "Capture New Face" button in the application window to capture a face using the webcam.

3. Enter Information: Enter the required information (name, surname, and phone number) in the dialog box that appears.

4. Save Data: The captured face, along with the entered information, will be saved in the `captured_faces` folder, and a WhatsApp message will be sent to the provided phone number with the captured photo.

5. Repeat Process: Repeat the process to capture additional faces if needed.

## Notes

- Ensure that your webcam is connected and functioning properly.
- Provide a valid phone number in the international format (e.g., +91XXXXXXXXXX) for receiving WhatsApp notifications.

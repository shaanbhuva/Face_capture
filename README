# Face Detection and Information Entry

This repository contains a Python application for face detection and information entry. It includes two main components: a Tkinter-based desktop application for capturing faces and entering information, and a Flask-based web application for displaying captured faces and information in a web interface.

## Features

- **Face Capture Application (Tkinter):**
  - Captures faces using a webcam.
  - Allows users to enter name, surname, and phone number for each captured face.
  - Saves captured faces and information in a SQLite database.

- **Web Application (Flask):**
  - Displays captured faces and information in a web interface.
  - Provides real-time updates using Flask-SocketIO.
  - Automatically refreshes the page every 2 seconds to check for new entries.
